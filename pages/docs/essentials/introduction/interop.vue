  Speckle operates on the basis of "lossy interoperability". What this means is that, for example, things might change in transit to better accomodate the host environment in which you are receiving data.

  There's a couple of more in-depth reads on how things actually work behind the scenes, namely:

  - Developer Documenation on [schemas and object models](/docs/developers/object-models)
