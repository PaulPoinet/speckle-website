  The [.NET SDK (SpeckleCore)](https://github.com/speckleworks/specklecore) lies at the base of the Grasshopper, Dynamo, Rhino, Gsa, and Revit connectors. It provides:

  - async methods for calling the Speckle [API](https://speckleworks.github.io/SpeckleOpenApi/)
  - methods for interacting with the Speckle's websocket API
  - the core conversion methods (`Serialise` and `Deserialise`) & other helper methods
  - a base SpeckleObject from which you can inherit to create your own [Speckle kits](/docs/developers/object-models)
  - methods for getting local accounts
  - methods for passing things through a local cache
