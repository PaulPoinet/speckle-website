  Thanks to [Antoine Dao](https://github.com/AntoineDao), there's a Golang client! That's quite cool. [Check it out here!](https://github.com/speckleworks/GoSpeckle)

  From the repo's readme:

  This is a client for the Speckle Server API written in [Go](https://golang.org/). The main reason for building another client in another language is that Golang offers some neat multi platform binary build capabilities (if a UI or a CLI tool is built in Go using this client as a base then it can be compiled to run on Windows, OSX, Linux and even mobile).
