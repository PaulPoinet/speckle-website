  Since [this blogpost about schemas and standards](/blog/schemas), from way back at the end of 2017, Speckle has moved forward. It's only one and half years ago, but wider industry adoption coupled with other initatives starting to develop, or already in possession of an internal object model, have led to the evolution of how speckle handles custom schemas.

  A quick recap: originally, Speckle came with its own, user extensible, object model, that consisted of mostly geometric primitives. That served us well into the days of pre 1.x; soon the need arose - both from a research point of view as well as industry requirements - to support existing object models. This led to the "speckle abstract", which was transpiling your C# classes into something could understand and work with.
